- Manipulate the existing financial data by generating new variables using multiple columns<br>
<br>
- Recall and apply the important statistical concepts (random variable, frequency, distribution, population and sample, confidence interval, linear regression, etc. ) into financial contexts<br>
<br>
- Build a trading model using multiple linear regression model <br>
<br>
